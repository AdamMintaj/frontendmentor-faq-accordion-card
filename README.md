# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [FAQ Accordion Card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

In this challenge the goal was to build a FAQ section with an accordion that the user can click to hide and show answers. Apart from that there were some hover states to apply and images to position. The extra challenge was to complete the thing without using javascript.

## How it went

Since I've already done this challenge some time ago I decided to redo it, but without javascript this time. Doing the same thing using only CSS turned to be more difficult than I thought it would be initially, but it also added to the fun.
The main problem to solve here was how to make the answers open and close - I decided to go with radio buttons and CSS selectors enabling elements corresponding to the currently active button. Thanks to the radio inputs the user can only have one open question at a time, which in my opinion is cool since it keeps the section nice and tidy. The downside is that you can't uncheck a radio input and the challenge said the user should be also able to close questions by clicking them (in which case checkboxes would work I guess) but I really wanted to have some fun with radio.
